## what are boids?
These are boids. They are an example of fairly complex behaviors coming from simple rules. They are supposed to be an accurate simulation of flock/schooling behavior that can be observed in birds/fish.

## what rules do boids follow?
There are lots of rules people have made for better boid simulations, but these boids follow the three most common rules:
- boids will try to match the velocity of nearby boids
- boids will move towards the center of mass of nearby boids
- boids will avoid crashing directly into eachother
